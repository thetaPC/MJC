/*
Problem (my understanding):
The question wants the programmer to create a simple program that allows users to 
insert a number. The code must then be able to determine if it is an even or odd.
Then the answer should be produced as such: The number (x) is an even/odd.

Solution:
I must use cout to inform the user to insert a number. I'll clarify by saying only 
a whole number must be inserted. The book suggests using a modulus operator (%) w/ 2. 
I finally looked up further information about this operator and it finally makes sense.
Therefore, I will have an If-Then statement using %2. The cout will give the 
user the information if their number is odd or even.

#include "..\..\std_lib_facilities.h"

int main()
{
	//variables
	int num1;

	//user input
	cout << "Enter a whole number: ";
	cin >> num1;

	//computation
	if (num1 % 2 == 0)
		cout << "The number " << num1 << " is even. \n";
	else
		cout << "The number " << num1 << " is odd. \n";

	return 0;

} //end main. I have successfully set up my project without needing to look up what I must insert first. :)

/*
It seems that my project worked the first time. I will have to further look for possible bugs before
I must turn it in.
