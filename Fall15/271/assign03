/*
Problem:
The quadratic formula is given. It wants a program
that evaluates the x, by showing its possible 
roots. However, b^2-4ac cannot be < 0. If there are
no real roots then it has to let the user know.

Solution:
Variable declarations will be used for a, b, c, x, and
possRoots (possible roots). possRoots will equal
b^2-4ac in order to find how many roots are available.
Then I'll split up the quadratic formula for the +-.
To make the code a bit cleaner, I will also declare
sqRoot for the answer that calculate: 
square root of b^2-4ac.
There must be two x's declared if there are two roots.

	//variable declarations
	double a;

	//user input

	cout << "Enter a number for a: ";
	cin >> a;
	cout << "Enter a number for b: ";
	cin >> b;
	cout << "Enter a number for c: ";
	cin >> c;

				//test 1
				//cout << (a + b + c) << "\n"; succeeded

	//determing & calculating roots
	possRoots = (pow(b,2) - (4 * a * c));
				//cout << possRoots << "\n";
	if (possRoots < 0)
	{
		cout << "There are no real roots. \n";
	}
	if (possRoots == 0)
	{
		x1 = (-((b) / (2 * a)));
		cout << x1 << "\n";
	}
	if (possRoots > 0)
	{
		sqRoot = sqrt(possRoots);
		x1 = ((-(b) + sqRoot) / (2 * a));
		cout << x1 << "\n";
		x2 = ((-(b) - sqRoot) / (2 * a));
		cout << x2 << "\n";
	}

	

	return 0;
}

/*
Final thoughts:
I have completed the assignment. I managed to do so by
reviewing the quadratic formula online. However, I will let it
sit for a few days. I will come back to review and make
any necessary changes.

The program seems to run fine after the review.
