Problem:
The first square equates to one grain of rice. The
second square equals to 2 grains. The third is equal
to 4 grain. And so on until reaching 64. Calculate
how many squares it would take to reach 1,000 and
1,000,000 and 1,000,000,000 grains. Loop will be
needed. Variables to keep track of the current square,
the number of grain for the current square, and
to keep track of the grains on all previous square.
This will be done with int. The amount of grains will
be added with each passing square.

Solution:
I'm actually not sure where to start with this. I've
thought about it for two days and still don't know.
But I think I'll try a vector. I can keep track of all
of them by storing them in a vector. No. Vector would
not work. But I do believe a For loop is needed. I
can store the current grain into one variable and the
grain amount into another. The last variable will be
a combination of both. I have yet figured out how to
display the specific square for the previous grain amount.
It might be an If statement. I have finally figured out
how to approach this with the professor's help.
ex: s0=1, s1=2, ...
2^0=0, 2^1=2, ...
